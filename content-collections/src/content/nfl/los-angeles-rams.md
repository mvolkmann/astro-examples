Just keep winning. The Rams are now 5-1 since their Week 10 bye week with their only loss being an overtime thriller against the Ravens. They have concerningly allowed the Commanders and Saints to close the gap late in the last two wins, but they looked like a clearly better team than New Orleans for most of that game. Of all the teams competing for a Wild Card spot in the NFC, the Rams look the most dangerous. They might get a chance to prove how dangerous in Week 18 against the 49ers.
