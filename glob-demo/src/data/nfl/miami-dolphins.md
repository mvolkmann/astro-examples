Miami finally got their signature win, but it was not easy.
After allowing the Cowboys to come back and take a one-point lead,
Tua Tagovailoa led a game-winning drive that ended with a field goal
as time expired. The road does not get any easier with a trip to
Baltimore up next and the Bills in the season finale,
but the Dolphins needed a win like this.
